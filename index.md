## Welcome to Summer Softball!

This site will be the official source of truth for all things scheduling related for the summer softball league. 

If you are new to 5v5v5 softball, please review the rules [here](https://static.spokanecity.org/documents/recreation/sports/tournaments/2017/softball-5v5v5-rules-2017.pdf). The only difference we will have from these rules is that one team will play the left side of the field (L, LC, 3B, SS, and C) and one team will play the right side (R, RC, 1B, 2B, and P). This will *hopefully* force more team interaction. 

The first team listed in the matchup will bat **first**, the second team will take the RIGHT side of the field, and the last team the LEFT side. The teams will then rotate clockwise for 5 innings (time capped at 1 and 30 minutes). Any ties and the two teams will both be awarded the points of the lower position.

*NOTE: If players would like to continue playing after the league games are over, whoever would like can stick around for a pick up game immediately following the league game.*
