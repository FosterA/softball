## Welcome to Summer Softball!

This site will be the official source of truth for all things scheduling related for the summer softball league. 

If you are new to 5v5v5 softball, please review the rules [here](https://static.spokanecity.org/documents/recreation/sports/tournaments/2017/softball-5v5v5-rules-2017.pdf). The only difference we will have from these rules is that one team will play the left side of the field (L, LC, 3B, SS, and C) and one team will play the right side (R, RC, 1B, 2B, and P). This will *hopefully* force more team interaction.
